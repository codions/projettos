## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- GD Library (>=2.0) or
- Imagick PHP extension (>=6.5.7)

## Installation

First set up a database, and remember the credentials.

```
git clone https://github.com/codions/projettos.git
composer install
php -r "file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');"
php artisan key:generate
npm ci
npm run production
```

Now edit your `.env` file and set up the database credentials, including the app name you want.

Optionally you may set up the language with `APP_LOCALE`, if your language is not working we accept PR's for new languages. We recommend copying those files from the `lang/en` folder.
As well as the timezone can be set with `APP_TIMEZONE`, for example: `APP_TIMEZONE="America/Sao_Paulo"`.

Now run the following:

```
php artisan app:install
```

And login with the credentials you've provided, the user you've created will automatically be admin.

## Role system

There's a simplified role system included in this roadmapping software. There's 3 roles: administrator, employee & user.

What are these roles allowed to do?

- Administrator
  - Obviously anything to users, items, projects, access admin
- Employee
  - These can access the admin, and see their assigned items (via a filter). What they can't do: settings, theme, users, CRUD projects.
- User
  - This is your default user when someone registers, they don't have access to the administration and can only access the frontend.

## GitHub integration

To enable the GitHub integration, add these values to your .env:

```
GITHUB_ENABLED=true
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

To get a GitHub token, visit this URL: https://github.com/settings/tokens

When enabled, you can assign a repository to each project via the admin panel.
For items in projects with a repo assigned, you'll be able to assign an issue or
easily create one via the roadmap admin.

## Installing SSO (OAuth 2 login with 3rd party app)

It is possible to configure OAuth 2 login with this roadmap software to make it easier to log in.
In this example we're going to show how to set this up with a Laravel application example, but any other OAuth 2 capable application should be able to integrate as well.

Start by installing Laravel Passport into your application, [consult their docs how to do this](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/passport#installation).

Now create a fresh client by running `php artisan passport:client`

It will ask you a few questions, an example how to answer these:

```
$ php artisan passport:client

Which user ID should the client be assigned to?:
> 

What should we name the client?:
> Roadmap SSO

Where should we redirect the request after authorization? [https://my-app.com/oauth/callback]:
> 

New client created successfully.
Client ID: 3
Client secret: 9Mqb2ssCDwk0BBiRwyRZPVupzkdphgfuBgEsgpjQ
```

Enter these credentials inside your .env file of the roadmap:

```
SSO_LOGIN_TITLE="Login with SSO"
SSO_BASE_URL=https://external-app.com
SSO_CLIENT_ID=3
SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=9Mqb2ssCDwk0BBiRwyRZPVupzkdphgfuBgEsgpjQ
SSO_CALLBACK=${APP_URL}/oauth/callback
# Mostly, your sso provider user endpoint response is wrapped in a `data` key.
# for example: { "data": "id": "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }
# If you would like to use a custom key instead of data, you may define it here.
# you can also do something like 'data.user' if its nested.
# or you can set it to nothing (do not set it to value 'null'. just leave it empty value) 
# if sso provider user endpoint response is not wrapped in a key.
SSO_PROVIDER_USER_ENDPOINT_DATA_WRAP_KEY="data"
# The keys that should be present in the sso provider user endpoint response
SSO_PROVIDER_USER_ENDPOINT_KEYS="id,email,name"
# The provider id returned by the sso provider for the user identification. sometimes its `uuid` instead of `id`
SSO_PROVIDER_ID="id"
SSO_ENDPOINT_AUTHORIZE=${SSO_BASE_URL}/oauth/authorize
SSO_ENDPOINT_TOKEN=${SSO_BASE_URL}/oauth/token
SSO_ENDPOINT_USER=${SSO_BASE_URL}/oauth/user
```

Next we're going to prepare the routes, controller & resource for your application.

Create these routes inside the `api.php` file:

```php
Route::get('oauth/user', [Api\UserOAuthController::class, 'user'])->middleware('scopes:email');
Route::delete('oauth/revoke', [Api\UserOAuthController::class, 'revoke']);
```

Create the resource: `php artisan make:resource Api/UserOAuthResource` with the following contents in the `toArray()` method:

```php
public function toArray($request)
{
    return [
        'id' => $this->id,
        'name' => $this->name,
        'email' => $this->email,
    ];
}
```

Create a controller `php artisan make:controller Api/UserOAuthController` and add these functions:

```php
use App\Http\Resources\Api\UserOAuthResource;
use Laravel\Passport\RefreshTokenRepository;
use Laravel\Passport\TokenRepository;

public function user(Request $request)
{
    return new UserOAuthResource($request->user());
}

public function revoke(Request $request)
{
    $token = $request->user()->token();

    $tokenRepository = app(TokenRepository::class);
    $refreshTokenRepository = app(RefreshTokenRepository::class);

    $tokenRepository->revokeAccessToken($token->id);

    $refreshTokenRepository->revokeRefreshTokensByAccessTokenId($token->id);
}
```

Also setup the tokens inside the `AppServiceProvider` inside the `boot()` method:

```php
public function boot()
{
    ... 
    
    Passport::tokensCan([
        'email' => 'Read email'
    ]);
}
```

Now head over to the login page in your roadmap software and view the log in button in action. The title of the button can be set with the `.env` variable: `SSO_LOGIN_TITLE=`


## Docker

### Getting up and running

`docker-compose up -d --build`

Set your database .env.docker variables:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=roadmap
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Composer Install:

`docker exec -it app composer install`

Running artisan commands:

`docker exec -it app php artisan <command>`

The Application will be running on `localhost:8080`
