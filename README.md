## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1

## Installation

First set up a database, and remember the credentials.

php artisan key:generate
npm ci
npm run production
```

Now edit your `.env` file and set up the database credentials, including the app name you want.

Optionally you may set up the language with `APP_LOCALE`, if your language is not working we accept PR's for new languages. We recommend copying those files from the `lang/en` folder.
As well as the timezone can be set with `APP_TIMEZONE`, for example: `APP_TIMEZONE="America/Sao_Paulo"`.

Now run the following:

```
php artisan app:install
```

And login with the credentials you've provided, the user you've created will automatically be admin.
